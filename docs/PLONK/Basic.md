Zero Knowledge Proof

---

Basic

Trusted setup( MPC Ceremony )

---

Proof and Verify

Two procedures:
1/ Proof generation(proof sth)
2/ Proof verify(verify the proof)

Example
Proof we are above the age of 18, without actually disclosing our age.

---

A Proof generated by sender, and verified by receiver.

Sender(Prover) ---> math statements ---> Receiver(Verifier)

---

Time Vary

Influences including:
1/ The use of Trusted setup
2/ The complexity of Proofs

Proof time:
The longer the proof times, the longer user has to wait before a transaction can be broadcast to the network.

Verify time:
the longer it takes time to verify proof, the fewer transactions can be included in the block.

Plonk - Updatable Referece String
1/ MPC to generate original reference string
2/ constantly updated
3/ verification time is near constant.
4/ the reference string is universal, do not have to recreate a trusted setup.
